    <h2>How to cook beef stir fry</h2>
    Before we begin the cooking process, it’s important to assemble all your ingredients beforehand. Luckily, for beef stir fry, there aren’t many ingredients that require preparation. Cut your 1 lb. of beef tenderloin into thin slices. This recipe calls for two bell peppers –– one red and one green. These should be chopped too, but the slices can be much thicker.
